# mcsrv.sh
**This script is quickest and easiest way to deploy a Minecraft server on a Linux Machine**
> This script is still in it's early phases and there are a lot of currently missing features, but they are steadily being added (see the planned features below).
Once it's complete, this script will be able to deploy most types of server software, with a selectable version. It will also have the option to go through some basic configuration settings for the `server.properties` file. Finally, the last planned feature is to have the option to quickly optimize your server according to the guide in [this spigot thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/).
